1 hello there ... look for the comments in the code.

2 i had litle problem with the scope of that exerciece at the begining, for me it's easy to overthink.
  the description did not help it's a litle vague, any way applay kiss rule,
  this api  shares json from another api with few filters , order changes that kind of stuff but not rocket sinece sure.
  there is little data verification and thats all.
  	
  


3 this project is made in symfony 5 (becouse i don't know much about laravel and Yii2) and i did not touch any other file than the controller it's simple.
